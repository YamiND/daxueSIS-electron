TODO List

Save DB File to the Flash Drive
	Perhaps I should use a file dialog if it can't find the DB
	Maybe have it choose the location and read that from a saved config?


Self Attendance
	Students should be able to select their ID (or Name?) from Class List
	  This mode the date should be prefilled to today's date 
	  Record the time that the student logged themselves as attended 
		This can be a NULL in the DB for the Admin mode

Assignments/Grading
	*Sigh* I should implement an assignments/grading mode into this

Weight System (Sadface)
